# Frogger Arcade Game on FPGA

This repository contains Verilog HDL files for synthesing Frogger Game on FPGA.

It has been proved and tested on with a `VGA Display`, `PS2 keyboard`, and `ALTERA UP2 Education Board`.

For demo, refer to this [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5RgYoGBTYg).

Happy HDLing and do let me know if you spin something off this code ;)
